## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
titanic <-read.csv("C:/Users/bthomas/Documents/Data Wranglinge/titanic_original.csv")
titanic$embarked <- sub("^$","S",titanic$embarked)

#titanic$age <-sub("NA",mean(titanic$age,na.rm = TRUE),titanic$age) - does not work for numerics
titanic$age[is.na(titanic$age)] <- mean(titanic$age,na.rm = TRUE)
titanic$boat <- sub("^$","NA",titanic$boat)
titanic <- 
    transform(
        titanic,
        has_cabin_number =
            ifelse( nchar(as.character(titanic$cabin)) == 0 , 0 ,1)
)
write.csv(titanic, file = "C:\\Users\\bthomas\\Documents\\Data Wranglinge\\titanic_clean.csv")

```
