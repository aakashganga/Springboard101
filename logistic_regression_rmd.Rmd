This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
##   Load the National Health Interview Survey data:
NH11 <-readRDS("C:/Users/bthomas/Documents/Data Wranglinge/logistic_regression/dataSets/NatHealth2011.rds") 
labs <- attributes(NH11)$labels

##   Let's predict the probability of being diagnosed with hypertension
##   based on age, sex, sleep, and bmi
str(NH11)
str(NH11$age_p)
str(NH11$hypev) # check stucture of hypev
levels(NH11$hypev) # check levels of hypev
# collapse all missing values to NA
NH11$hypev <- factor(NH11$hypev, levels=c("2 No", "1 Yes"))
# run our regression model
hyp.out <- glm(hypev~age_p+sex+sleep+bmi,
              data=NH11, family="binomial")
coef(summary(hyp.out))

##   Generalized linear models use link functions, so raw coefficients are
##   difficult to interpret. For example, the age coefficient of .06 in the
##   previous model tells us that for every one unit increase in age, the
##   log odds of hypertension diagnosis increases by 0.06. Since most of us
##   are not used to thinking in log odds this is not too helpful!
##   One solution is to transform the coefficients to make them easier to
##   interpret

hyp.out.tab <- coef(summary(hyp.out))
hyp.out.tab[, "Estimate"] <- exp(coef(hyp.out))
hyp.out.tab

# Create a dataset with predictors set at desired levels
predDat <- with(NH11,
                expand.grid(age_p = c(33, 63),
                            sex = "2 Female",
                            bmi = mean(bmi, na.rm = TRUE),
                            sleep = mean(sleep, na.rm = TRUE)))
# predict hypertension at those levels
cbind(predDat, predict(hyp.out, type = "response",
                       se.fit = TRUE, interval="confidence",
                       newdata = predDat))

##   This tells us that a 33 year old female has a 13% probability of
##   having been diagnosed with hypertension, while and 63 year old female
##   has a 48% probability of having been diagnosed.

## Exercise: logistic regression
## ───────────────────────────────────

##   Use the NH11 data set that we loaded earlier.

##   1. Use glm to conduct a logistic regression to predict ever worked
##      (everwrk) using age (age_p) and marital status (r_maritl).
##   2. Predict the probability of working for each level of marital
##      status.

##   Note that the data is not perfectly clean and ready to be modeled. You
##   will need to clean up at least some of the variables before fitting
##   the model.
# run our regression model
everwork.out <- glm(everwrk~age_p+r_maritl,data=NH11, family="binomial")
coef(summary(everwork.out))
#exp.everwork.out <-exp(coef(everwork.out))
#exp.everwork.out

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
